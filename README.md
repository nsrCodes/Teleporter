# Terminal tool for easy navigations thorugh your directories
*Go thorugh the [setup guide](https://github.com/nsr-py/Teleporter/blob/master/setup.md) to use it on your system*

As a programmer and a regular Linux user the idea of browsing the web of ddirectories using your terminal used to seem nice at first but now it just gets on my nerves to remember the directory structure to navigate, so much so that I put in 2 days to build this ("I know its too long but, I am a rookie")

And not just through the terminal, its sometimes even hard to find the desired folder in the file explorer
There are shell commands like $alias to get by this but I wanted a more daily approach. And this project helped me from changing.

Using teleporter ypu can set aliases for different locations on your system. And these alias names can also be easily managed. Look at the [user guide](https://github.com/nsr-py/Teleporter/blob/master/user_guide.md)
